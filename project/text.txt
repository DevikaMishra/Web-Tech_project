Texts with potential educational value are becoming available through the Internet (e.g., Wikipedia, news services). However, using these new texts in classrooms introduces many challenges, one of 
which is that they usually lack practice exercises and assessments. Here, we address part of this challenge
by automating the creation of a specific type of assessment item.
Specifically, we focus on automatically generating factual What questions and Fill in the Blanks. 
This is an automated system that can take as input a text and produce as output questions for assessing a
reader's knowledge of the information in the text. The questions could then be presented to a teacher,
who could select and revise the ones that he or she judges to be useful.


It is a unique solution that provides teachers to conduct tests or exams in your organization or Institute. Generally higher authorities are heavily dependent on typists when there is a question of preparing test papers. It happens even when the organizatio has a pool of good questions already typed. Over this pool of questions typists and teachers are engaged for hours in the cycle of cut-paste-print out-corrections.
